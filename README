#Fibonnaci Clock
The idea of this proyect it was to create a homemade Fibonnaci's Clock in a summer. If you don't know what it is I recomend you to search it, because it is so cool.
I use 5 ledstrips for iluminate the five sections, a lcd screen to show the hour and minute in a digital way, a homemade circuit board that I did create with some transistors,resistors and integrated circuits to controll  strips and a Arduino Nano to change hours and minutes, controll lcd screen, buttons...
In the next days I'm gonna publish the schema of the board, so you will be able to build one.
